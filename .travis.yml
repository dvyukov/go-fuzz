# There are currently two main sets of tests
#   1. Running go-fuzz-build and go-fuzz on dvyukov/go-fuzz-corpus/png starting with an empty corpus,
#      and it validates >1 entry appears in the corpus. This uses what was formerly the required
#      arguments like -workdir and -bin.
#   2. Running go-fuzz-build and go-fuzz on dvyukov/go-fuzz/test, which contains some regression tests, etc.
#      This uses the newer ability to not supply any required arguments to go-fuzz-build and go-fuzz.
