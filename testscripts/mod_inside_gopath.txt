# These steps validate we can fuzz inside of GOPATH
# with GO111MODULE on and off.

# Here, we purposefully do not test with GO111MODULE auto and unset,
# because the meaning of auto within GOPATH has changed with
# Go 1.13, and the meaning of unset will likely change in Go 1.14
# (and some chance auto could change meaning again in Go 1.14).
# However, the Go 1.13 and 1.14 changes ultimately translate
# to what external conditions enable or disable module mode
# for cmd/go. Testing here with GO111MODULE on and off allows
# us to explicitly test with cmd/go's module mode enabled and disabled in GOPATH,
# which is our current goal here. (These are not cmd/go tests after all).
 
# The foo module being fuzzed depends on a 'replace' 
# in its go.mod to find one of its dependencies, and that dependency bar
# is located *outside* of GOPATH, which is a way to check that
# module-mode is required to compile successfully.
# (Other go-fuzz tests validate that non-module targets work in GOPATH with 
# cmd/go's module mode disabled; that has been the status quo).

# Enter a simple module with a fuzz function.
# This is inside GOPATH.
cd gopath/src/example.com/foo

# Copy a pristine go.mod file.
cp go.mod_PRISTINE go.mod

# First, we test with GO111MODULE=on, which will likely be the default in Go 1.14.
env GO111MODULE=on

# Sanity check the module seems well formed.
exec go list -m all

# Because cmd/go now defaults to -mod=readonly, we need to explicitly add go-fuzz-dep.

# Ask go-fuzz-build to build, including specifying the fuzz function for mod.

# Validate we can start fuzzing.
# Note that 'timeout(1)' will error here, so we preface the invocation with '!'.
# For travis on Windows, we install 'timeout(1)' as part of our travis setup steps.
# To test this locally on Windows, you might need to change 'timeout' to '\cygwin64\bin\timeout' or similar.
! exec timeout 5 go-fuzz -procs=1 -func=FuzzMod
stderr 'workers: \d+, corpus: '

# Clean up.
cp go.mod_PRISTINE go.mod

# Second, we test with GO111MODULE=off.
# The meaning of this is unlikely to change in Go 1.14,
# altough in some (distant?) future, GO111MODULE=off might
# no longer be supported.
env GO111MODULE=off

# Confirm 'go list -m' and 'go build' fail.
! exec go list -m all

# example.com/foo has a fuzz function, and depends on example.com/bar.
