# These steps validate we get a proper error
# if we try to fuzz a module using GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor.
# It then stops.

# For the future, we have some unexecuted steps after the stop.
# These don't run now, but attempt to validate fuzzing a module using -mod=vendor,
# including validating that the actual code in the 'vendor' directory is used.

# TODO: -mod=vendor is not yet supported with go-fuzz, so the majority of this test is disabled with a 'stop' command.
# If you change go-fuzz-build to remove the check for -mod=vendor, it currently fails with error:
#    > exec go-fuzz-build -func=FuzzDependOnVendor
#    [stderr]
#    could not load packages: go [list -e -json -compiled=true -test=false -export=false -deps=true -find=false -tags gofuzz -- .

# TODO: this test currently relies on latest go-fuzz/go-fuzz-dep and go-fuzz-defs
# versions on master being downloaded from github as part of the tests.
# If this test is run in a go-fuzz branch and there have been signficant
# changes to go-fuzz/go-fuzz-dep and go-fuzz-defs in the branch, this test 
# will use the versions from master and might incorrectly fail.
# If that happens, the foo/go.mod below can temporarily be modified to point 
# to the branch, or this test can temporarily be ignored or removed.

# directory has been edited compared (so that we can validate the vendored
